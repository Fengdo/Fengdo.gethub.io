      <section class="markdown-content"><p>A red pony colt was looking at him out of the stall. Its tense ears were forward and a light of disobience was in its eyes. Its coat was rought and thick as an Airedale’s fur and its mane was long and tangled. Jody’s throat collapsed in on itself and cut his breath short.</p>
<p>“He needs a good currying,” his father said, “and if I ever hear of you not feeding him or leaving his stall dirty,I’ll sell him off in a minute.”</p>
<p>Jody couldn’t bear to look at the pony’s eyes any more. He gazed down at his hands for a moment, and he asked very shyly, “Mine?” No one answered him. He put his hand out towqrd the pony. Its gray nose came close, sniffing loudly, and then the lips drew back and the strong teeth closed on Jody’s fingers. The pony shook its head up and down and seemed to laugh with amusement. Jody regarded his bruised fingers. “Well,” he said with pride – “Well,I guess he can bite all right.” The two men laughted, somewaht in relief. Carl Tiflin went out of the barn and walked up a sidehill to be by himself, for he was embarrassed, but Billy Buck stayed. It was easier to talk to Billy Buck. Jody asked again – “Mine?”</p>
<p>Billy became professional in tone. “Sure!That is,if you look out for him and break him right. I’ll show you how. He’s just a colt.You can’t ride him for some time.”</p>
<hr>

<p>Jody put out his bruised hand again, and this time the red pony let his nose be rubbed. “I ought to have a carrot,” Jody said. “Where’d we get him, Billy?”</p>
<p>“Bought him at a sheriff’s auction,” Billy explained. “A show went broke in Salinas and had debts. The sheriff was selling off their stuff.”</p>
<p>The pony stretched out his nose and shook the forelock from his wild eyes. Jody stroked the nose a little. He said softly, “There isn’t a – saddle?”</p>
<p>Billy Buck laughed. “I’d forgot.Come along.”</p>
<p>In the harness room he lifted down a little saddle of red morocco leather.”It’s just a show saddle,” Billy Buck said disparagingly. “It isn’t practical for the brush, but it was cheap at the sale.”</p>
<p>Jody couldn’t trust himself to look at the saddle either, and he couldn’t speak at all. He brushed the shining red leather with his fingertips, and after a long time he said, “It’ll look pretty on him though.” He thought of the grandest and prettiest things things he knew. “If he hasn’t a name already, I think I’ll call him Gabilan Mountains,” he said.</p>
<p>Billy Buck knew how he felt. “It’s a pretty long name. Why don’t you just call him Gabilan? That means hawk.That would be a fine name for him.” Billy felt glad. “If you will collect tail hair, I might be able to make a hair rope for you sometime. You could use it for a hackamore.”</p>
