<p>Donald climbed down from the boulder and looked around the bottom of the huge rock. The path actually circled the rock，and there was a flat place with a little protection that was perfect. He sat down to think.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to set up his tent. He still thought that the troop leader would come around the bend and find him at any moment. His buddy should have told the leader by now. They would be looking for him.</p>
<p>It was time to mate the job easier for them by making a fire. Donald looked around the area for some tinder to make his fire. The best tinder was dried dead moss or small dry pieces of wood that had fallen from trees. Small dry leaves also worked because they would catch a spark and start a fire. He found lots of tinder around his boulder and stacked it up the way he had been taught. Then he gathered some bigger sticks and one small dry log to put on the fire once it started. He was ready to start the fire.</p>
<p>In order to get a spark，he had to strike his knife against the flint,<br>His flint was a small gray stone he kept in a pouch. He struck it with his knife a few times and was happy to see a spark jump off the flint, catch in the tinder, and spread to make a small fire. Then he put the bigger sticks on the growing fire.</p>
<p>Eventually, he sat down and warmed his hands by the fire. it was exactly the kind of small fire Donald needed. He felt warmer already.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfdtw0rns/image/upload/c_fill,h_400,w_700/v1577544860/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E7%AB%99%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87/15-2_oza501.jpg" alt="插图1"></p>
<p>With the fire going，Donald felt a little beter，He warmed his fingers and his toes by the fire and wished he had some marshmallows to put in the fire. He was sure his troop was eating them now. He was hungry, too. He tore open another energy bar and ate it quickly. It was not quite the same as a marshmallow.</p>
<p>Donald huddled by the fire. He was still a little scared. He was lost in the wilderness, and there wasn’t much he could do. There was no gas station where he could ask directions and no phone to use. There was wildlife all around him, too.</p>
<p>Donald thought he might as well put his tent up if they weren’t going to find him that night. The tent was complicated, though. He struggled with the poles and almost put on in the fire by accident.</p>
<p>he was about to give up when he heard a racket out beyond his fire. The noise was loud, but he couldn’t figure out what it was. Who was making that racket? He hoped it wasn’t a bear coming down the path.<br>He listened for the noise again. The next time it was louder, and he knew what it was. It was his name! He picked up a log from the ground and waved it in the air and yelled and yelled.</p>
<p>Finally, his troop leader and buddy came around the bend. Donald was so happy to see them that he hugged them both. The leader was a little angry, but he said Bonald did the right thing by staying near the path with a fire. His buddy apologized for losing him, but Donald was too happy to care.</p>
