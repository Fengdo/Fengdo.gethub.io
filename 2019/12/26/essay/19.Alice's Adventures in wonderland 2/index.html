<p>She <strong>generally</strong> gave herself very good advice,(though she very <strong>seldom</strong> followed it), and sometimes she <strong>scolded</strong> herself so <strong>severely</strong> as to bring <em>tears</em> into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to <em>box</em> her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of <strong>croquet</strong> she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of <em>pretending</em> to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one <strong>respectable</strong> person!’</p>
<p>Soon her eye <em>fell on</em> a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked <em>in currants</em>. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can <strong>creep</strong> under the door; so either way I’ll <em>get into</em> the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’</p>
<p>She ate a little bit, and said <em>anxiously</em> to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, <em>holding</em> her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she <em>remained</em> the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of <em>expecting</em> nothing but <em>out-of-the-way</em> things to happen, that it seemed quite <strong>dull</strong> and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>
<p>So she set to work, and very soon <em>finished off</em> the cake.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfdtw0rns/image/upload/c_fill,h_400,w_700/v1577803159/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E7%AB%99%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87/19-2_qx7yzi.jpg" alt="插图"></p>
<p>… Just then her head <strong>struck</strong> against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once <em>took up</em> the little golden key and <em>hurried off</em> to the garden door.</p>
<p>Poor Alice was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more <em>hopeless</em> than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>
<p>‘You ought to be <em>ashamed</em> of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a great girl like you’(she might well say this), ‘to go on crying in this way！ Stop this moment, I tell you!’ But she went on all the same, <strong>shedding gallons</strong> of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching <em>half down the hall</em>.</p>
<p>After a time she heard a little <strong>pattering</strong> of feet in the <em>distance</em>, and she <strong>hastily</strong> dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, <strong>splendidly dressed</strong>, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, <strong>muttering</strong> to himself as he came, ‘Oh！the Duchess, the Duchess！ Oh！ won’t she be <strong>savage</strong> if I’ve kept her waiting！” Alice felt so <strong>desperate</strong> that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, <em>in a low</em>, <em>timid voice</em>, ‘If you please, sir –’</p>
