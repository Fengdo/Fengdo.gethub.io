      <section class="markdown-content"><p>They would chatter and call good night and make a big fuss before they parted, and then the forest would be as quiet as the apartment house on Third Avenu when all the kids were off the streets and all the parents had said their last words to each other and everyone had gone to their own little hole.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the wind howled and the snow blew, the chickadees would be out for only<br>a few hours. Even Mr. Bracket, who had been elected by the chickadees to test whether or not<br>it was too stormy for good hunting, would appear for a few hours and disappear. Sometimes! would find him just sitting quietly on a limb next to the bole* of a tree, all fluffed up and doing<br>nothing. There was no one who more enjoyed doing nothing on a bad day than Mr. Bracket of Third Avenue.</p>
<p>Frightful, the two Mr. Brackets, and I shared this feeling. When the ice and sleet and snow drove down through the hemlocks, we all holed up.</p>
<p>I looked at my calendar pole one day, and realized that it was almost Christmas. Bando will come, I thought.I’ ll have to prepare a feast and make a present for him. I took stock of the frozen<br>venison* and decided that there were enough steaks for us to eat nothing but venison for a month.<br>I scooped under the snow for teaberry plants to boil down and pour over snowballs for dessert.</p>
<p><hr><br>…” And now, I have something to show you” he said. He reached in his coat pocket and took out a newspaper clipping，It was from a New York paper，and it read：<br>WILDECY SUSPECTEDLIVING OFF DEER AND NUTS IN WILDERNESS OF CATSKILLS</p>
<p>I looked at Bando and leaned over to read the headline myself.<br>“Have you been talking?” I asked.<br>“Me？Don’t be ridiculous. You have had several visitors other than me.”<br>“The fire warden — the old lady！” I cried out.</p>
<p>“Now，Thoreau，this could only be a rumor. Just because it is in print，doesn’t mean it’s true. Before you get excited，sit still and listen.”He read:”‘Residents of Delhi，in the Catskill Mountains，<br>report that a wild boy，who lives off deer and nuts，is hiding out in the mountains.“Several hunters stated that this boy stole deer from them during hunting season.’”</p>
<p>“I did not！” I shouted.“I only took the ones they had wounded and<br>couldn’t find.”</p>
<p>“Well that’s what they told their wives when they came home without their deer. Anyway，listen to this:”‘This wild boy has been seen from<br>time to time by Catskill residents，some of whom believe he is crazy！’”</p>
<p>“Well that’s a terrible thing to say！”<br>“Just awful，” he stated.” Any normal red-blooded American boy<br>wants to live in a tree house and trap his own food. They just don’t<br>do it，that’s all.” “Read on,” I said.</p>
