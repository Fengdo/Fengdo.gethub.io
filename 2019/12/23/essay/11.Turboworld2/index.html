<p>Finally, the group arrived at Turboworld, and Jeremy’s dad bought their tickets. “Where do you want to go first?” asked Jeremy’s dad. Jeremy wanted to ride the Twisting Falls of Horror right away, but James said he didn’t want to ride the most exciting ride first because everything afterward would be boring. Ling wanted to play some games before the rides.</p>
<p>“Roller coasters make me nauseated anyway,” Ling said when Jeremy asked about the roller coaster.</p>
<p>Jeremy finally said that it would be okay to wait a couple of hours. After all, the trip had already been postponed a week. What was another hour or two?</p>
<p>Jeremy’s dad said they could go on some rides, but they should come up with a plan for what to ride first. Val wanted to ride the Spinning Swans because she knew that at least she would stay right-side up. James really liked heights, so he wanted to ride the Ferris wheel. Ling liked anything fast, so she chose the Racing Turbo Beatles. Jeremy’s dad wanted to ride the Bouncing Bumper Car because he liked to drive. After going on all of these rides, the group stopped for lunch.</p>
<p>They finally found themselves under the Twisting Falls of Horror. Everyone stopped to stare up at the colossal roller coaster in disbelief. “That does look pretty cool,” said Jeremy’s dad. Val shook her head and watched as a roller coaster car came around the curve above them and then went in an upside-down loop, causing the riders to scream.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Val. “Can’t you hear those people screaming?”</p>
<p>“That is the scream of fun,” said Jeremy, but Val didn’t look convinced.</p>
<p><hr><br><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfdtw0rns/image/upload/c_fill,h_400,w_700/v1577097518/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E7%AB%99%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87/11_fs2nxs.png" alt="插图2"></p>
<p>The group watched as people exited the ride.<br>“How did everyone get wet?” asked Ling.<br>“The Falls of Horror is actually waterfalls that pass through caves,” explained Jeremy.”Come on Val,” he said to his sister who now looked even more unsure. “What can I do to convince you that this will be really fun?”</p>
<p>“Alright,” she said, “but if I agree to ride the roller coaster, you have to rake the lawn for the rest of the fall.”</p>
<p>Val was surprised when Jeremy didn’t oppose her demand. She had thought it would work for sure, but now she was stuck riding the Twisting Falls of Horror.</p>
<p>Once she was sitting in her car, she stared up at the colossal first hill of the roller coaster. As the car inched up the hill, Val couldn’t help smiling. She knew that the slow climb up the hill was what would give the car its speed for the rest of the ride. As the car raced down the track and traveled around a triple loop, she screamed with glee. By the time they traveled around the curve into the waterfall cave, she had decided to apologize to her brother. This was the best ride of the day, and she felt bad for having been so disagreeable before. She, Ling, and her father exited the ride soaking wet and laughing.</p>
<p>“That was awesome!” exclaimed Val, smiling at her brother and James. But when she saw Jeremy’s pale face, her smile turned to a frown. “What’s wrong, Jeremy?” she asked her brother.<br>“Nothing, “he said, “I just didn’t think it would be so scary.”</p>
