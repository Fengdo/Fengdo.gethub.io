<p>Somewhere right now, the sun is making the wind blow. Without the sun, you would not see the wind blow the leaves in the fall, and you would not feel the cold air blow in a winter storm. The sun heats the earth and the air above it, but it does not heat every part of the earth the same amount. This leaves some cool air and some warm air above the earth. Warm air weighs less than cool air, so it rises above the cool air. The cool air then moves in to take the place of the rising warm air. This movement is the wind!</p>
<p>People have used wind as a source of power for thousands of years. Wind can be strong enough to push objects. Wind can also control the direction in which an object moves. Wind does not always blow with the same strength or in the same place, but since it will always blow again, it is an effective supply of power.</p>
<p>Wind power can be used in different ways. If you have ever flown a kite, you have used wind power. The ancient Egyptians first used the wind to make sailboats move. Later, people in Asia and the Middle East realized wind could be converted to other kinds of power. They built mechanical windmills, which helped pump water and grind grain into four. This knowledge was passed on to people in Europe who started to use windmills, too.</p>

<p>A windmill functions by catching the wind in its blades. When the wind blows over the windmill’s blades, they turn. Old-fashioned windmills were attached to other tools. Often the tool was a stone used to grind grain for bread. When the windmill’s blades turned, a part of the windmill pushed the grinding stone. The stone then crushed the grain below it. Other windmills were attached to a water pump. When the windmill’s blades turned, the pump moved water.</p>
<p>These water-pumping windmills were used to pump water from one place to another. Sometimes windmills helped to transform countries by moving water. The country of Holland is famous for its windmills. Holland has so much water that people wanted to move some of it. Thanks to windmills, parts of Holland that used to be underwater are now dry. Moving the water made traveling around the country easier, too. In the United States, windmills were used to bring water to people who lived in areas without many lakes or other bodies of water. Special windmills were even built to pump water from underground. Without windmills, settlers would probably not have been able to farm the frontier.</p>
<p>Though wind power has been less popular in recent years, it is making a comeback. Today’s wind machines work much like old-fashioned windmills. They still have blades that turn when the wind blows over them, but unlike old-fashioned windmills, they are not attached to pumps or grinding tools. They are attached to machines that convert wind power into electricity. The electricity is then delivered through electrical lines to homes, businesses, and cities.</p>
