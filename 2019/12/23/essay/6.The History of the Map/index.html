<p>People have always needed to know where they are and how to travel to where they want to go. Long before we used maps, people used the stars to tell direction. A person who knew where a star was during a certain time of year could use it to travel. Sailors at sea used the stars to help them travel. At sea, sailors saw nothing but water for a long time, and until recently, they did not have radios or communication tools. Instead, they looked up to the sky to help them.</p>
<p>Sailors also found their way with the compass, which uses magnets to determine direction. The compass was first used in China, but later it was used in different parts of the world. The Chinese compass used the magnet to point south. Later, compasses were made to point north. If a sailor knew which way was north, he could easily find south, east, and west. This tool made travel at sea much safer and easier. It is still used by many people today.</p>
<p>A map can also show direction, but it gives much more information, too. People long ago realized that making pictures could help to show the location and give directions. Early maps were pictures drawn on animal skins, pieces of clay, and wood. They gave a lot of information, even before the written word and legends* were used in maps. These maps showed things such as settlements, landmarks, and the location of water.</p>

<p>The earliest maps were probably drawn in the Middle East. Some of these maps have survived. Taken together, they show what people thought the world looked like at that time. They also show us that people who made them saw the earth as flat. In different places, and over time, the pictures became more detailed and correct. Early on, the Chinese made maps that gave detailed information. The ancient Greeks used their knowledge of math and science to make maps. Greek maps tell us that the Greeks knew the world was round.</p>
<p>From simple pictures, map making has turned into a science. Maps are made by surveying land. In the 1900s, people around the world started to share information to make better maps. Photographs taken from the sky and space also help us see what the world looks like. Mapmakers use these pictures to make maps. Maps are now more correct and more detailed than ever, but since the world is always changing, we will always need new maps.</p>
<p>There are many types of maps, but almost all use words and pictures to show what a place is like at the time the map is made. A map usually has a legend that shows what the pictures stand for. Some maps may show the entire world. A road map shows a smaller piece of the world. A road map will have a scale to help you know the distance from one place to another. Other maps may use pictures to show the climate —— the temperature and weather —— in different places.</p>
