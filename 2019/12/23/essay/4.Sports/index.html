<p>When you think of sports，you probably think of popular American games such as football or baseball.However，these games have only been played for a brief time when compared to other sports that have around for thousands of years. Many different types of athletic games are played all over the world. Soccer and volleyball are played in the United States but are more popular in other places. Some American games are based on other sports that were played before them.</p>
<p>A game played in one place often resembles a game played in another part of the world.Bats，balls，and nets are used in many sports. The words goal,score，inning, and bowl are also used in many sports，but they may have different meanings in each game. Bowling is an example of a sport that is played in more than one place. It has different rules and names in other places. In other countries，bowing games are played outside and may use balls instead of pins. Bowling games are played all over the world，including lreland，Italy，and France.</p>
<p>Baseball came from another sport called cricket. Most people believe that cricket began as a children’s game about 500 years ago. Like basaball，cricket is played with a bat and a ball. Cricket is also played in nnings，but a cricket match may take days to finish！Cricket is one of the most popular games in the world. Cricket began in England but is played in many places.<br>including India.</p>

<p>Polo may be the oldest team sport in the world, but it would probably look very new to you if you had never seen it before. Polo was first played 2,500 years ago in what is now Iran. Because it was played by many of the world’s kings and rulers, it is sometimes called “The Game of Kings.”</p>
<p>In some ways, polo resembles hockey. Players use long sticks with heads shaped like hammers to try to score a goal. So why might polo look different from the athletic games you usually see?</p>
<p>Polo is played on horseback! The balls fly rapidly, sometimes faster than 100 miles an hour.</p>
<p>Another older sport that might look new to you is played with kites. You probably think of flying a kite as a peaceful activity on a windy day, and in most places it is. But kites are also used in a rather dangerous-looking game called kite fighting. Kite fighting is popular in Asia and South America. In a kite fight, the kites have sharp objects inside. The players try to force the other team’s kite to the ground. A kite fight can be very brief or as long as an hour.</p>
<p>Someday our own games will be played differently. New twists have already been put on modern games. One example is Octopush, a strange game first played in the 1950s. It was based on hockey and was played in a swimming pool with<br>flippers, face masks, and other underwater gear!</p>
