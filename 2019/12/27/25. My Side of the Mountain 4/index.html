      <section class="markdown-content"><p>“Dad!” I screamed, and dove right through the door onto my stomach. I all but fell down the mountain shouting. “Dad！ Dad！ Where are you？”I found him resting in a snowdrift, looking at the cardinal pair that lived near the stream. He was smiling, stretched out his back, not in exhaustion, but in joy.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas!” he whooped. I ran toward him. He jumped to his feet,tackled me, thumped my chest, and rubbed snow in my face.</p>
<p>Then he stood up, lifted me from the snow by the pockets on my coat, and held me off the ground so that we were eye to eye. He sure smiled. He threw me down in the snow again and wrestled with me for a few minutes. Our formal greeting done, we strode up to the mountain.</p>
<p>“Well, son,” he began. “I’ve been reading about you in the papers and I could no longer resist the temptation to visit you. I still can’t believe you did it.”</p>
<p>His arm went around me. He looked real good, and I was overjoyed to see him.<br>“How did you find me?” I asked eagerly.<br>“I went to Mrs. Fielder, and she told me which mountain. At the stream, I found your raft and ice_fishing holes. Then I looked for trails and footsteps. When I thought I was getting warm, I hollered.”</p>
<p>“Am I that easy to find?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t have to answer, and I’d probably have frozen in the snow.” He was pleased and not angry at me at all.</p>
<p><hr><br>He said again, “I just didn’t think you’d do it. I was sure you’d be back the next day. When you weren’t, I bet on the next week; then the next month. How’s it going?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s a wonderful life, Dad!”<br>When we walked into the tree, Bando was putting the final touches on the venison steak.</p>
<p>“Dad, this is my friend, Professor Bando; he’s a teacher. He got lost one day last summer and stumbled onto my camp. He liked it so well that he came back for Christmas. Bando, meet my father.”</p>
<p>Bando turned the steak on the spit, rose, and shook my father’s hand.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to meet the man who sired this boy,” he said grandly. I could see that they liked each other and that it was going to be a splendid Christmas. Dad stretched out on the bed and looked around.</p>
<p>“I thought maybe you’d pick a cave,” he said. “The papers reported that they were looking for you in old sheds and houses, but I knew better than that. However, I never would have thought of the inside of a tree. What a beauty!Very clever, son, very, very clever. This is a comfortable bed.”</p>
<p>He noticed my food caches, stood and peered into them.”Got enough to last until spring?”</p>
<p>“I think so,” I said. “If I don’t keep getting hungry visitors all the time.”I winked at him.</p>
<p>“Well, I would wear out my welcome by a year if I could, but I have to get back to work soon after Christmas.”</p>
