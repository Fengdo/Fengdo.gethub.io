      <section class="markdown-content"><p>Jody wanted to go back to the box stall. “Could I lead him to school, do you think – to show the kids?”</p>
<p>But Billy shook his head. “He’s not even halter-broke yet.We hand a time getting him here. Had to almost drag him. You better be starting for school though.”</p>
<p>“I’ll bring the kids to see him here this afternoon,” Jody said.</p>
<p>Six boys came over the hill half an hour early that afternoon, running hard, theri heads down, their forearms working, their breath whistling. They swept by the house and cut across the stubble-field to the barn. And then they stood self-consciously before the pony, and then they looked at Jody with eyes in which there was a new admiration and a new respect.Before today Jody had been a boy, dressed in overalls and a blue shirt – quieter than most, even suspected ancient admiration of the footman for the horseman. They knew instinctively that a man on a horse is spiritually as well as physically bigger than a man on foot. They knew that Jody had been miraculously lifted out of equality with them, and had been placed over them. Gabilan put his head out of the stall and sniffed them.</p>
<p>“Why’n’t you ride him?” the boys cried. “Why’n’t you braid his tail with ribbones like in the fair?””When you going to ride him?”</p>
<hr>

<p>Jody’s courage was up. He too felt the superiority of the horseman. “He’s not old enough.Nobody can ride hime for a long time. I’m going to train him on the long halter. Billy Buck is going to show me how.”</p>
<p>“Well, can’t we even lead him around a little?”</p>
<p>“He isn’t even halter-broke,” Jody said. He wanted to be completely alone when he took the pony out for the first time. “Come and see the saddle.”</p>
<p>They were speechless at the red morocco saddle, completely shocked out of comment. “It isn’t much use in the brush,” Jody explained. “It’sll lokk pretty on him though. Maybe I’ll ride bareback when I go into the brush.”</p>
<p>“How you going to rope a cow without a saddle horn?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll get another saddle for every day. My father might want me to help him with the stock.” He let them feel the red saddle, and showed them the brass chain throat-latch on the bridle and the big brass buttons  at each temple where the headstall and brow band crossed. The whole thing was too wonderful. They had to go away after a little while, and each boy, in his mind, searched among his possessions for a bribe worthy of offering in return for a ride on the red pony when the time should come.</p>
<p>Jody was glad when they had gone. He took brush and currycomb from the wall, took down the barrier of the box stall and stepped cautiously in.</p>
