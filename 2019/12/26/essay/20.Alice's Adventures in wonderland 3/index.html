<p>The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.</p>
<p>Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: ‘Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morming? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’ And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure I’m not Ada,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she’s she, and I’m I, and – oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is — oh dear!</p>

<p>… CHAPTER VIl. The Queen’s Croquet-Ground </p>
<p>A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the rose growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!’</p>
<p>‘I couldn’t help it,’ said Five, in a sulky tone; ‘Seven jogged my elbow.’</p>
<p>On which Seven looked up and said, ‘That’s right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!’</p>
<p>‘You’d better not talk!’ said Five. ‘I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!’</p>
<p>‘What for?’ said the one who had spoken first.</p>
<p>That’s none of your business, Two!’ said Seven.</p>
<p>‘Yes, it is his business!’ said Five,’ and I’ll tell him – it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.’</p>
<p>Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust things –’ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p>
<p>‘Would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly,’ why you are painting those roses?’</p>
<p>Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, ‘Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.’     </p>
