      <section class="markdown-content"><p>She generally gave herself very good advice,(though she very seldom followed it),and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.’But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people!Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’</p>
<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants.’Well,I’ll eat it,’said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I canreach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’</p>
<p>She ate a little bit,and said anxiously to herself,’Which way?Which way?’,holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out_of_the_way things to happen,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.</p>
<p>So she set to work,and very soon finished off the cake.</p>
<p><hr><br>… Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p>
<p>Poor Alice was as much as she could do，lying down on one side，to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.</p>
<p>‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself,’ said Alice, ‘a great girl like you’（she might well say this），’to go on crying in this way！Stop this moment，I tell you!’ But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears，until there was a large pool all round her，about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.</p>
<p>After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance，and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning，splendidly dressed，with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry，muttering to himself as he came，‘Oh！the Duchess，the Duchess！Oh！won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting！”Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one；so，when the Rabbit came near her，she began，in a low，timid voice，‘If you please，sir—‘</p>
