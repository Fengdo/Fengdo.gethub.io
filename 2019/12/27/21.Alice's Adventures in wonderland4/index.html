      <section class="markdown-content"><p>“So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes，to – ‘At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out ‘The Queen!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p>
<p>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers*; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples:they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came the King and Queen of Hearts.</p>
<p><hr><br>Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of a procession,’ thought she,’ if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p>
<p>When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?”She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p>
<p>‘idiot!’ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?’</p>
<p>‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’ re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’</p>
<p>And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.</p>
<p>‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. It’s no business of mine.’</p>
<p>The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed ‘Off with her head! Off–’</p>
<p>‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen<br>was silent.</p>
