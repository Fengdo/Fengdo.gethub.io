<p>For a long time, the giant squid was thought to be a legend that didn’t exist. In stories, the giant squid was a sea monster that attacked ships. Even when giant squid became stuck on beach shores, they were taken for mermen*! But now we know the giant squid is real. No person has seen them in their natural habitat, but witnesses have glimpsed these creatures above water and sometimes washed up on the shore. Recently, one was even captured and brought onto land.</p>
<p>Just how gigantic is a giant squid? It is one of the biggest animals on earth. The biggest of them can be almost 60 feet long and weigh over two tons. An adult giant squid is about the size of a school bus, but a baby can be as small as a cricket, The giant squid has ten limbs. Eight of these are called arms. Two of the limbs are elongated and are called tentacles. The arms and tentacles are covered with sharp suckers that help the squids catch food.</p>
<p>Scientists are still not sure what these squids eat or how fast they can swim. Like most squid. they probably live no longer than five years, but even this is just a guess. Scientists still have much to learn about these sea animals. Much of what they know comes from studying the remains of giant squid found in the stomachs of the sperm whales that eat them!</p>

<p>Scientists now think that there are many giant squids. These gigantic sea animals live in most of the earth’s oceans, so why do we know so little about them? First, by the time they wash up on the shore, they are no longer alive. No giant squid has lived after being captured in fact a giant squid was recently caught alive for the first time, but it did not survive. A giant squid’s home is in very dark, cold water which is often thousands of feet below sea level Researchers cannot safely go into water that deep, and even if they did, they could not see! Although the giant squid has eyes the size of volleyballs, sunlight cannot penetrate the very deep water, and the giant<br>squid must use the light of other ocean life to see.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists have found ways of learning more about the giant squid. A group of Japanese scientists sent an underwater camera deep into the ocean to take pictures. These pictures gave people the first glimpse of the giant squid in its natural habitat!</p>
<p>Scientists learned from the pictures that the giant squid probably swims faster than they had once thought. When the squid got stuck on the researchers’ hook, one of its elongated limbs was cut off. The scientists used this tentacle to guess the total length of the squid. They could see from their pictures that the squid was able to free itself. It was able to live without the tentacle.</p>
