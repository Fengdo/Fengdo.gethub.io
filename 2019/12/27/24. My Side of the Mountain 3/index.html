      <section class="markdown-content"><p>“ ‘Officials say that there is no evidence of any boy living alone in the mountains and add that all abandoned houses and sheds are routinely checked for just such events. Nevertheless, the residents are sure that such a boy exists！’ End story.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of nonsense！” I leaned back against the bedstead and smiled.</p>
<p>“Ho, ho, don’t think that ends it，” Bando said，and reach in his pocket for another clipping. “This one is dated December fifth, the other was November twenty-third. Shall I read?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>OLD WOMAN REPORTS METING WLD BOY WHILE PICKING STRAWBERRIES IN CATSKILLS</p>
<p>“ ‘Mrs. Thomas Fielder, ninety-seven, resident of Delhi, N.Y., told this reporter that she met a wild boy on Bitter Mountain last June while gathering her annual strawberry jelly supply.</p>
<p>“ ‘She said the boy was brown-haired，dusty，and wandering aimlessly around the mountains. However, she added，he seemed to be in good flesh and happy.</p>
<p>“ ‘The old woman，a resident of the mountain resort town for ninety-seven years, called this office to report her observation. Local residents report that Mrs.Fielder is a fine old member of the community, who only occasionally sees imaginary things.’ “</p>
<p>Bando roared. I must say I was sweating，for I really did not expect this turn of events.</p>
<p>And now，”went on Bando，” and now the queen of the New York papers. This story was buried on page nineteen.No sensationalism for this paper.”</p>
<p><hr><br>BOY REPORTED LMNG OFF LANDIN CATSKILLS</p>
<p>“ ‘A young boy of seventeen or eighteen, who left home with a group of boy scouts, is reported to be still scouting in that area, according to the fire warden of the Catskill Mountains.</p>
<p>“ ‘Evidence of someone living in the forest — a fireplace, soup bones, and cracked nuts  — was reported by Warden Jim Handy, who spent the night in the wilderness looking for the lad. Jim<br>stated that the young man had apparently left the area, as there was no evidence of his camp upon a second trip — ‘ “</p>
<p>“What second trip?” I asked.</p>
<p>Bando puffed his pipe, looked at me wistfully* and said, “Are you ready to listen?”</p>
<p>“Sure, “I answered.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s the rest of it. ‘…there was no trace of his camp on a second trip, and the warden believes that the young man returned to his home at the end of the summer.’</p>
<p>“You know, Thoreau, I could scarcely drag myself away from<br>the newspapers to come up here. You make a marvelous story.” …</p>
<p>“I gave Bando his presents when he returned. He liked them.<br>He was really pleased; I could tell by his eyebrows. They went<br>up and down and in and out. Furthermore, I know he liked the<br>presents because he wore them.</p>
<p>The onion soup was about to be served when I heard a voice<br>shouting in the distance, “I know you are there!I know you are<br>there! Where are you?”</p>
