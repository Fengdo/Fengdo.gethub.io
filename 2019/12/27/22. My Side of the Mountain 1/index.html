<p>Frightful and I settled down to living in snow. We went to bed early, slept late, ate the mountain harvest, and explored the country alone. Oh, the deer walk with us, the foxes followed in our footsteps, the winter birds flew over our heads, but mostly we were alone in the white wilderness. It was nice. It was very, very nice. My deerskin rabbit-lined Sut Was so warm that even when my breath froze in my nostrils, my body was snug and comfortable. Frightful fluffed on the coldest days, but a good flight into the air around the mountain would warn her, and she would come back to my fist with a thump and a flip. This was her signal of good spirits.</p>
<p>I did not become lonely, Many times during the summer I had thought of the “long winter months ahead” with some fear. I had read so much about the loneliness of the farmer, the trapper, the woodsman during the bleakness of winter that I had come to believe it. The winter was as exciting as the summer — maybe more so. The birds were magnificent and almost tame. They talked to each other, warned each other,  fought for food, for kingship, and for the right to make the most noise. Sometimes I would sit in my doorway, which became an entrance to behold — a portico* of pure white snow, adorned with snowmen — and watch them with endless interest.</p>
<p><hr><br>They reminded me of Third Avenue, and l gave them the names that seemed to fit.</p>
<p>There was Mr.Bracket. He lived on the first floor of our apartment house, and no one could sit on his step or even make a noise near his door without being chased.Mr.Bracket, the chickadee, spent most of his time chasing the young chickadees through the woods. Only his mate could share his favorite perches and feeding places.</p>
<p>Then there were Mrs.O’Brien, Mrs. Callaway, and Mrs.Federio.On Third Avenue they would all go off to the market together first thing in the morning, talking and pushing and stopping to all go off to the market together first thing in the morning, talking and pushing and stopping to lecture to children in gutters and streets.Mrs.Federio always followed Mrs.O’Brien, and Mrs.O’Brien always followed Mrs. Callaway in talking and pushing and even in buying an apple. And there they were again in my hemlock; three busy chickadees. The would flit and rush around and click and fly from one eating spot to another. They were noisy, scolding and busily following each other. All the other chickadees followed them, and they made way only for Mr.Bracket.</p>
<p>The chickadees, like the people on Third Avenue, had their favorite routes to and from the best food supplies. They each had their own resting perches and each had a little shelter in a tree cavity to which they would fly when the day was over.</p>
