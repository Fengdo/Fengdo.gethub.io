      <section class="markdown-content"><p>He usually ran the last little way to the barn. He unlatched the rusty hasp of the barn door and stepped in, and no matter how quietly he opened the dorr, Gabilan was always looking at him over the barrier of the box stall and Gabilan whinnied softly and stamped his front foot, and his eyes had big sparks of red fire in them like oakwood embers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if the work horses were to be used that day, Jody found Billy Buck in the barn harnessing and currying. Billy stood with him and looked long at Gabilan and he told Jody a great many things about horses. He explained that they were terribly afraid for their feet, so that on must make a practice of lifting the legs and patting the hoofs and ankles to remove their terror.He told Jody how horses love conversation. He must talk to the pony all the time, and tell him the reasons for everything.Billy wasn’t sure a horse could undersand everything that was said to him, but it was impossible to say how much was understood. A horse never kicked up a fuss if some on he liked explained thins to him. Billy could give examples, too. Hhad known, for instance, a horse nearly dead beat with fatigue to perk up when told it was only a little farther to his desination. And he had known a horse paralyzed with fright to come out of it when his rider told him what it was that was frightening him.</p>
<hr>

<p>While he talked in the mornings, Billy Buck cut twenty or thirty straws into neat three-inch lengths and stuck them into his hatband. Then during the whole day, if he wanted to pick his teeth or merely to chew on something, he had only to reach up for one of them.</p>
<p>Jody listened carefully, for he knew and the whole county knew that Billy Buck was a fine hand with horses.Billy’s own horse was a stringy cayuse with a hammer head, but he nearly always won first prize at the stock trials. Billy could rope a steer, take a double half-hitch about the horn with his riata, and dismount, and his horse would play the steer as an angler plays a fish, keeping a tight rope until the steer was sown or deaten.</p>
<p>Every morning, after Jody had curriend and brushed the pony, he let down the barrier of the stall, and Gabilan thrust past him and raced down the barn and into the corral. Around and around he galloped, and sometimes he jumped forward and landed on stiff legs. He stood quivering, stiff ears forward, eyes rolling so that the whites showed, pretending to be frightened. At last he walked snorting to the water-trough and buried his nose in the water up to the nostrils. Jody was proud then, for he knew that was the way to judge a horse. Poor horses only touched their lips to the water, but a fine spirited beast put his whole nose and mouth under, and only left room to breathe.</p>
