<p>CHAPTER 1. Down the Rabbit-Hole </p>
<p class="translation">章节1.兔子洞下</p>

<p>Alice <em>was beginning to</em> <em>get very tired of</em> sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,’and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversation?’</p>
<p></p><p class="translation">Alice非常讨厌她的妹妹坐在银行无事可做。一次、两次的偷看她妹妹正在看的书，但书里并没有图片和内容。“这本书有什么用？没有图片和内容？”Alice想。</p>
<p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the <strong>pleasure</strong> of making a <strong>daisy-chain</strong> would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the <strong>daisies</strong>, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes <em>ran close by</em> her.</p>
<p></p><p class="translation">她沉浸在自己的内心里。(尽她所能，炎热的天气让她感觉非常困乏和笨拙)</p>
<p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late! ‘(when she thought it over afterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfdtw0rns/image/upload/c_fill,h_400,w_700/v1577801097/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E7%AB%99%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87/18-2_chxo7z.jpg" alt="插图"></p>
<p>… ‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’</p>
<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle.I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>
<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>
<p>‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’</p>
