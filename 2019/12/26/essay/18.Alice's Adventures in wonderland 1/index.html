<p>CHAPTER 1. Down the Rabbit-Hole </p>
<p class="translation">章节1.兔子洞下</p>

<p>Alice <em>was beginning to</em> <em>get very tired of</em> sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had <strong>peeped</strong> into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversation?’</p>
<p></p><p class="translation">Alice非常讨厌她的妹妹坐在银行无事可做。一次、两次的偷看她妹妹正在看的书，但书里并没有图片和内容。 “这本书有什么用？没有图片和内容？” Alice想。</p>
<p>So she was <strong>considering</strong> in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the <strong>pleasure</strong> of making a <strong>daisy-chain</strong> would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the <strong>daisies</strong>, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes <em>ran close by</em> her.</p>
<p></p><p class="translation">她沉浸在自己的内心里。(尽她所能，炎热的天气让她感觉非常困乏和笨拙)</p>
<p>There was nothing so very <strong>remarkable</strong> in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterward, it <strong>occurred</strong> to her that she <em>ought to</em> have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its <strong>waistcoat-pocket</strong>, and looked at it, and then <em>hurried on</em>, Alice started to her feet, for it <em>flashed across</em> her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with <em>curiosity</em>, she <em>ran across</em> the field after it, and <em>fortunately</em> was just in time to see it <strong>pop</strong> down a large rabbit-hole under the <strong>hedge</strong>.</p>
<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfdtw0rns/image/upload/c_fill,h_400,w_700/v1577801097/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD%E7%AB%99%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87/18-2_chxo7z.jpg" alt="插图"></p>
<p>… ‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be <em>shutting up</em> like a <em>telescope</em>.’</p>
<p>And so it was <em>indeed</em>: she was now only ten inches high, and her face <strong>brightened</strong> up the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to <strong>shrink</strong> any <em>further</em>: she felt a little <em>nervous</em> about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’said Alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle.I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to <em>fancy</em> what the <em>flame</em> of a candle is like after the candle is <strong>blown out</strong>, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>
<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she <em>decided on</em> going into the garden at once; but, <strong>alas</strong> for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she <em>went back</em> to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite <strong>plainly</strong> through the glass, and she tried her best to <em>climb up</em> one of the legs of the table, but it was too <strong>slippery</strong>; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>
<p>‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather <strong>sharply</strong>; ‘I advise you to <em>leave off</em> this minute!’</p>
